Up to 40% of the proceeds can be deducted, so Atsuko plans to donate at least 40% (i.e., if the proceeds were $1M, $400K would be donated). And the tax accountants guesstimate that about half of the remaining proceeds would be taxes (i.e., with the same example, Atsuko would net something like $300K after taxes and donations).</p>`
